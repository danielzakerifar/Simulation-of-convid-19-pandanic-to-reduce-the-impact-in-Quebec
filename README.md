# Simulation-of-convid-19-pandanic-to-reduce-the-impact-in-Quebec
The pandemic of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-
2, which causes COVID-19 and started from China, is one of the
deadliest diseases in the world. Since it is new virus, the
countries try to know more about that to deal with it. One of the
way of studying about that is simulation of the covid-19
pandemic. In this article, we try to simulate, by Agent based
modeling and System Dynamic, Covid-19 spread and how we
can decrease the speed of that to have less infected people,
especially in Quebec
